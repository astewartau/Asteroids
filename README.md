# Asteroids in SFML!

This project is an implementation of the 1979 space shooter - Asteroids. It is being developed to demonstrate various engine design principles using SFML, and as the basis for a workshop series at QUT for the Game Development Club.

This version of Asteroids uses its own game engine which implements a state manager for game states, and an Entity-Component system to manage in-game objects.
